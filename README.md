# Movie-sentiment-analysis

Movie	reviews	are	an	important	way	to	understand	the	performance	of	a	movie.		While	providing	a	numerical/stars	rating	to	a	movie	tells us	about	the	success	or failure	of	the movie,	a	collection	of	movie	reviews	is	what	gives	us	a	deeper	qualitative	insight	on	different	aspects	of	the movie.	A	textual	movie	review	tells	us	about	the	the	strong	and	weak	points	of	the	movie	and	deeper analysis	of	a	movie	review	can	tell	us	if	the	movie	in	general	meets	the	expectations	of	the	reviewer.

Sentiment	 Analysis is	 a	major	 subject	 in	machine	 learning	 which	 aims	 to	 extract	 subjective	information	from	the	textual	reviews.	The	field	of	sentiment	of	analysis	is	closely	tied	to natural	language	processing	and	text	mining.	It	can	be	used to determine	the	attitude	of	the	reviewer	with	respect	to	various	topics or	the	overall	polarity	of	review.	Using	sentiment	analysis,	we	can	find	the	state	of	mind of	the	reviewer	while	providing	the	review	and	understand	if	the	person	was	“happy”,	“sad”,	“angry”	and	so	on.	

Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.
Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.
